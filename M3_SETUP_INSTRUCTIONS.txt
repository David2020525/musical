================================================================================

I have prepared everything for M3 implementation. Here's what's ready:

✅ COMPLETED PREPARATIONS:

📋 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (30-45 minutes):

Follow the guide in SETUP_GUIDES.txt to create accounts for:
1. Neon PostgreSQL - Database hosting
2. Cloudflare R2 - File storage for audio/images
3. Iyzico Payment - Payment gateway (sandbox)

If you encounter any issues during signup:
